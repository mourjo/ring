# Ring

Ring is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI
and Ruby's Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple,
unified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular
components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web
servers, and web frameworks. This is a forked version of Ring from 1.8.1
that includes the following additional changes:

1. Support for a timeout handler that can be passed to the Jetty adapter
2. Tracking request ingestion time in the request map from Jetty

The [SPEC][1] file at the root of this distribution provides a
complete description of the Ring interface.

## Upgrade Notice

From version 1.2.1 onward, the ring/ring-core package no longer comes
with the `javax.servlet/servlet-api` package as a dependency (see
issue [#89][2]).

If you are using the `mourjo/ring-core` namespace on its own, you may
run into errors when executing tests or running alternative adapters.
To resolve this, include the following dependency in your dev profile:

    [javax.servlet/servlet-api "2.5"]

[2]: https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/pull/89

## Libraries

* ring-core - essential functions for handling parameters, cookies and more
* ring-devel - functions for developing and debugging Ring applications
* ring-servlet - construct Java servlets from Ring handlers
* ring-jetty-adapter - a Ring adapter that uses the Jetty webserver

## Installation

To include one of the above libraries, for example `ring-core`, add
the following to your `:dependencies`:

    [mourjo/ring-core "1.0.0-1.8.1"]

To include all of them:

    [mourjo/ring "1.0.0-1.8.1"]
